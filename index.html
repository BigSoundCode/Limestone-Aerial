        <p class = "content">In the past, infrastructure which has been challenging to access has been inspected using conventional methods, for example, from aerial lifts, swing stages, and even helicopters. These methods can be very costly, time consuming, and can be unsafe. The use of drone technology can dramatically reduce the  cost and time required to complete these inspections, is much safer than conventional approaches, and with the appropriate equipment, can collect the most relevant data.</p>
